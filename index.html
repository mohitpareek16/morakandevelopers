            <p class="_1type">1 – Small Business Websites</p>

            <div class="lines">
                <p>Over the past two decades or so, it’s become crucial for brick and mortar stores to have a website.
                    As time
                    passes, it’s become more relevant. Now, you also need to have a social media presence.

                </p>
                <p>It’s become critical because the internet has become a necessity in our lives rather than the novelty
                    it once
                    was decades ago.</p>

                <p>>We not only watch fun videos, but we pay our bills, communicate, organize our lives, work, and shop
                    for most
                    things from groceries and furniture to clothes, electronics, and everything in between.</p>

                <p>That’s why businesses must have a website that’s user-friendly and should be able to quickly provide
                    all the
                    details a customer needs.</p>

                <p>These details include hours of operation, contact details, location details with a map, and other
                    relevant
                    details. It can even include the ability to book services or place orders online.</p>

                <div class="lines">
                    <p>What are the websites to build if you want to showcase your work? It’s the portfolio type of
                        website. They
                        display images of your projects or art in a photo gallery.</p>
                    <p> Images don’t have to be arranged in a grid, but they often are, as it’s on-trend. When a user
                        clicks on an
                        image, they not only see it in greater detail but with more aspects of your work on that
                        particular project.
                    </p>
                    <p>A portfolio site is an ideal website to create if you want to be able to direct potential
                        employers or
                        clients
                        to examples of your work so you can get hired quickly.</p>
                    <p>A “contact” or “hire me” page is often also included so there’s an easy way to get in touch with
                        you about
                        potential work.</p>

                    <p class="_1type">3 – Non-Profit Websites</p>
                    <div class="im">
                        <img src="img/jane-goodall-december-2020.jpg" alt="website">
                    </div>
                    <div class="lines">
                        <p>Non-profit types of websites aim to provide both information on a charity as well as a way
                            for people to
                            donate. While you could just provide a phone number for people to call, that’s rather old
                            fashioned.

                            Nowadays, you can create a non-profit website for a charity that accepts donations directly
                            on their
                            website.

                            If you’re a freelancer looking for a type of website to create, the non-profit type of
                            website is a great
                            option. Charities are often looking for help with creating a website since they’re usually
                            on a strict
                            budget
                            and can’t afford to hire a large agency.

                            A good non-profit type of website has an impeccable sales copy. It should really entice
                            users to donate.
                            The
                            process should also be straightforward.

                            <p>The word “blog” is the short form for “weblog.” It’s a digital journal. It started as a
                                trend for
                                individuals,
                                but it grew as businesses started using them to update customers as well as offer
                                valuable and
                                informative
                                content.

                            </p> These types of websites can just offer reading material. But, there are also other
                            types of blogs,
                            for
                            example, that can also sell products like a book written by the blog’s author or ad space.

                            </p>The difference between a blog and a regular website is that a blog is a website to
                            create if you only
                            want to
                            publish blog articles. The typical website has other features and components like the other
                            types of
                            websites in
                            this list.

                            </p>They’re the type of website to create if you want to quickly share life updates with
                            friends and
                            family.

                            Or, you could start a blog chronicling your specific journey. Many people do this to gain a
                            large
                            following. Then,
                            they can sell advertising space and make money doing something they enjoy or were already
                            going to do.</p>
